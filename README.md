# AWS Cloud Operations Lab

Hands-on AWS cloud operations and infrastructure lab.

This repository is the central hub for all of my AWS projects.  
Each project is documented and maintained in its own repository, with detailed
architecture, deployment steps, and learning outcomes.

I use this lab to build, test, and document real-world AWS environments that
reflect how cloud infrastructure is deployed, secured, and operated in
production systems.

## What this lab represents

- Real AWS infrastructure, not simulations  
- Production-style cloud architectures  
- Secure, scalable, and fault-tolerant systems  
- Automation through Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD  
- Monitoring, logging, and cost-aware operations

## Why I built this

I created this lab to gain hands-on experience with AWS Cloud Operations and
to prepare for roles such as Cloud Support Engineer, Cloud Operations Engineer,
and DevOps Engineer.

Everything here is designed to mirror how AWS is used in real production
environments.
